<h3>Intended Uses</h3>


<p>The Grand Unified Track Browser (GUTB) is a visualisation tool intended to be used to visualise wide one-dimensional data. The primary use so far has been to visualise 'omics data (gene density, methylation, etc). A working version of the GUTB can be found at https://genomevis.usask.ca/guob/ .</p>

<p>The various track components can be used to visualise other sets of data as well.</p>

<p>The GUTB has been built with React/Redux, and incorporates the [Groupware Toolkit](https://github.com/kiranbandi/GroupwareToolkitClient) for real-time collaboration.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>Multiple Track Types</h4>
<p>The GUTB supports several track types, rendering datasets procedurally as a line graph, histogram, bar-chart, scatter plot, or heatmap.</p>
<p>If self-hosting, there is another track type configured to use pre-rendered images, for faster load times.</p>

<h4>Linkages</h4>
<p>The GUTB supports synteny linkages like those found in [Synviso](https://synvisio.github.io/#/), to visualise relations between data points.</p>

<h4>Interactive</h4>
<p>The GUTB is fully interactive, supporting modern interaction techniques, such as zooming, panning and dragging to re-arrange tracks.</p>

<h4>Annotation</h4>
<p>The GUTB supports annotating track positions, so the user is able to make note of important data points or regions and can easily compare them against other areas.</p>

<h4>Split View</h4>
<p>Compare different areas of the same dataset.</p>
